put different floating pieces with lyrics on it, and the idea of the game is that in each level there is a particular song from that album - so you have to pick all the right lyrics to that song (there'll be many decoys as well, goal is to pick the correct ones) and can show a counter of how many lyrics are there (or can do some other picking game - like items from that era or something) and once the counter is full (like 13/13 items found) can move to the next era

also play her fav song from that album (like a small clip) during the time she takes to complete that level

Floating fragments gently drift in random directions
Can rotate slightly, bounce a little when clicked
Background elements (like clouds or leaves) slowly move across the screen
CSS animations for sparkle effects
Correct lyrics fade out or "pop" when clicked
Maybe a little shimmer trail when collecting?

background is aesthetic with thematic art (not taylor pics)
Playful animations: floating, drifting, sparkles

Along with the floating lyric fragments:
Sprinkle in floating iconic trinkets or symbols from each album
Clicking a trinket gives bonus points, sparkles, or a fun sound
They float around like lyrics but styled differently (maybe sparkle or glow)
Click = satisfying animation (sparkles, sound)
Trinket counter shows: Trinkets Found: 2/3
